# Nebula

An Atom UI theme that's *out of this world*. Works best with the [nebula-syntax theme](https://github.com/tjkohli/nebula-syntax).

## Meet the colors.

![Nebula colors](http://tjkoh.li/nmlY/12d2Hgpc+)

The seven colors used throughout Nebula UI and [Nebula Syntax](https://github.com/tjkohli/nebula-syntax) were painstakingly test on more than eight different monitors (sRGB, Adobe RGB, and intentionally/unintentionally miscalibrated) to ensure breadth of gamut. The colors were also tested in a monochromatic environment to ensure their contrast levels are exactly the same, so no one color is brighter than another. Then, the colors were given one final tweak to make them a bit more beautiful.

## Context-aware. Minimally invasive.

Modals fly above your code. Inputs come to life when activated. Non-editor panes slowly fade into the deep blue-gray background when you're not working in them. Every little detail has been visited, and revisited.

*Syntax errors detected in your code pulse a deep red underglow.*
